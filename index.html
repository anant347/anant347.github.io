			<h3>Literature survey of rarefied gas surface-scattering models, and surface-erosion models and the implementation of the LLY scattering model in Python</h3>
			<br>
			<div id="rcorners1">
				<p> SPARC Industries develop plasma simulation software to simulate Plasma Propulsion systems for satellites. My work involved researching rarefied gas-surface scattering, and plasma-induced surface erosion models.<br><br>
					
					1. Surface scattering: Modelling the reflection of an incident particle on colliding with the surface. Surface roughness affects the direction of the particle velocity and energy exchange with the surface affects the magnitude of the reflected particle velocity. The modeling can be done using molecular dynamics (that operates in the atomic scale and cannot efficiently incorporate surface roughness) or by stochastic methods like the CL model (doi.org/10.1080/00411457108231440) and the LLY model (doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2017.08.061). The models were described in the report delivered to SPARC Industries. The LLY model mimics trends resulting from molecular dynamics simulation and also takes surface roughness into account. The LLY model was implemented in Python and tested by comparing the results with those in the paper as well by running plausibility tests. A unit testing script was also written. The code and explanation of techniques used to speed up simulation were delivered to SPARC Industries.<br><br>
					
					2. Surface erosion: Modeling of surface erosion due to bombardment by an incident particle. This is done by first determining the 'sputtering yield' for a gas-surface combination. 'Sputtering yield' is the measure of surface atoms lost due to the impact of a single incident atom. Once one has the 'sputtering yield' for different incident polar angles and energies for a particular gas-surface combination, one can predict the erosion rate of the surface provided the plasma flow simulation is accurate. There are 4 methods to do so: Molecular dynamics, Stochastic, Semi-empirical, and transport. Within these 4 methods, there are different models that were described in the report delivered to SPARC industries.

			<h3>Literature study and preliminary design of a solar thermal propulsion system for a Lunar CubeSat mission</h3>
			<br>
			<div id="rcorners1">
				<p> The project consisted of coming up with a concept design of a solar propulsion thermal system satisfying the requirements of the LUMIO (LUnar Meteoroid Impacts Observer) mission which is an ESA selected proposal for a CubeSat mission to a halo orbit at Earth–Moon second Lagrange point to observe, quantify, and characterize meteoroid impacts on the lunar far side. The project report was a deliverable for the Micropropulsion [AE4S07] course at TU Delft.</p>
				
				<p>	Trade-offs were performed on several sub-system concepts to select a set best satisfying the requirements. Operation of the propulsion system was described and whenever possible, a trace to a requirement was included. Iterations were performed over a parametric range to come up with parameters that yielded optimum mass and volume. Corresponding to these parameters results such as total mass, total volume, and nozzle shape were determined. Sizing for an equivalent H2O2 monopropellant system was also performed over the same parametric range for comparison.</p>

			<h3>Assessing flight path vulnerabilities over the himalayan terrain</h3>
			<br>
			<div id="rcorners1">
				<p> A computational system was developed linking the weather simulation model, WRF, and the CFD software, Star-CCM+, to assess the affect of a weather system on an aircraft. A system demonstration was carried out using a case study of a scenic mountain flight on a Beechcraft 1900D aircraft from Kathmandu to Mt. Everest and back on the 9th of July 2018 2115hrs UTC. The project demonstrates the importance of such a system and how it can be used by the aviation industry to optimize flight planning and ultimately save cost and lives. </p><br>

			<h3>Bending and elastic stability study of Functionally graded graphene reinforced porous nanocomposite curved beams</h3>
			<br>
			<div id="rcorners1">
				<p>Static bending and elastic stability analyses were carried out on functionally graded graphene platelets reinforced
					porous nanocomposite curved beams using higher order shear deformation theory that accounts for through-thickness
					stretching effects. The structural characteristics of curved beam, constituting of porous metal foam and graphene 
					platelets as nanofillers for reinforcement, are evaluated considering different dispersion patterns for the graphene 
					and porosity, shallowness of the curved beam, thickness ratio, and platelet geometry.</p><br>

				<h3>AIAA Design Competition: Undergraduate Team Space Transportation – Pluto Orbiter</h3>
				<br>
				<div id="rcorners1">
					<p>An orbital exploration mission of the Pluto-Charon system was proposed. For the competition, 
						teams had to design a spacecraft and mission that can achieve orbital insertion into the 
						Pluto-Charon system with a primary mission length of no more than 25 years with a minimum 
						of a one year Pluto orbital duration.
						
						<br> My work primarily involved selecting the propulsion and power systems for the spacecraft 
						which involved the development of a <a href="https://github.com/anant347/Ion-Propulsion-system-comparison-tool.git">script</a> 
						to perform trade-offs between several commercial ion-propulsion engines constrained to the mission's requirement. </p><br>

					<div id="rcorners1">
						<p>Composite plates subjected to thermal loads were numerically analysed using finite 
							element methods based on first-order shear deformation theory. Parameters considered 
							include - boundary condition, curvilinear fibre angles at the centre and edge of the lamina, lay-up, thickness 
							ratio, coefficients of thermal expansion, and modular ratio.</p><br>
