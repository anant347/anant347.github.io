	<h3>Response Surface Based Design Optimization of a Low-Pressure Microresistojet's Heat Exchanger</h3>
	<p>A Low-Pressure Micro-resistojet (LPM) is a type of in-space electrothermal propulsion system for satellites that works by heating low-pressure (50 to 300 Pa) fluid flowing through microchannels/slots (typically < 1 mm diameter) using resistive heating elements like thin-film Molybdenum. This thesis delineates a response surface based method to explore and optimize the cross-sectional design of microchannels, which, as documented in literature, have so far only been either rectangular or circular in shape. <br><br>
	Experimental studies place the efficiency of LPM systems at 25% which can be increased to 30% by reducing heat losses from the heat exchanger to the plenum. The concept is still in its early stages of development and therefore offers plenty of opportunities in the improvement of the propulsion system whether it be regarding the choice of propellant, design of propellant management system, choice of thruster materials or the design of the microchannels, which is the focus of this thesis. Usage of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize the design of a microchannel for greater thrust efficiency requires the following steps: Design of Experiment (DoE) run to select samples from the design space, performing experiments to evaluate the performance of selected samples, building a response surface (or surrogate model) from the generated data and finally using an optimization algorithm to find a high-efficiency design. In this thesis, these steps were performed using (respectively): Sobol Sequences, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method using Sparc Industries' VSTRAP software, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA).<br><br>
	As a case study, the optimization was performed for Argon as the propellant, inlet pressure of 50 Pa, inlet temperature of 300 K and microchannel wall temperature of 600 K. The number of design parameters were set as 8 though the base geometry supports higher numbers as well. Using Sobol sequences to determine parametric values, 512 designs (termed polar designs) were generated. After DSMC simulations (validated with an experimental study in literature), the best performing design was found to have a thrust efficiency of 0.7019. 512 Rectangular designs were generated as well among which the best performing design had a thrust efficiency of 0.6566. From this dataset, the main takeaway is that the thrust efficiency peaks at a certain slot area and that small areal rectangular slots, common in literature, are not as efficient as broader slots with higher cross-sectional area (up to a limit). The CNN was trained on the polar dataset (CNN1) as well as the combination of both datasets (CNN2) to predict thrust efficiency from slot images. The predictions were, on average, within 10% from the simulation results. A GA run with 8-parameter geometry and with CNN1 as the response surface resulted in an optimum design with a thrust efficiency of 0.732. With CNN2, the optimized efficiency for 8-parameter and 15-parameter geometry was 0.7281 and 0.7455 respectively. However, on simulating the GA results it was found that CNN1 and CNN2 had overestimated the thrust efficiency by 11%. Thus in this case study, the most thrust efficient design is the best one from the polar dataset. The conclusion drawn is that a high number of designs generated using Sobol Sequences are enough to find the best performing design for a given set of input conditions i.e. choice of propellant, inlet pressure and temperature, and heaterchip temperature. As it seems that there is a strong correlation between slot area and performance, the number of designs to be generated can be based on whether it spans the allowable minimum to the allowable maximum area set by the designer. However, if the correlation between slot area and performance is not found after a DoE run for a different set of input conditions, then a CNN would have to be trained and used by the GA for design optimization. <br><br>
	The thesis concludes with a design recommendation for the shape of a microchannel that may on experimental testing result in a high performing thruster. Improvement in LPM technology will further the capabilities of PocketQube satellites (5 x 5 x 5 cm^3 form factor) and also of large satellites for which it could function as precise attitude control thrusters. Low pressure operation allows for a compact and lightweight propellant management system and the thruster's high thrust-to-power ratio gives it a major advantage over competing propulsion systems such as hall-effect and electrospray thrusters.<br><br>

	<h3>Literature survey of rarefied gas surface-scattering models, and surface-erosion models and the implementation of the LLY scattering model in Python</h3>
	<p> SPARC Industries develop plasma simulation software to simulate Plasma Propulsion systems for satellites. My work involved researching rarefied gas-surface scattering, and plasma-induced surface erosion models.<br>
	<ol>				
	<li>Surface scattering: This deals with modelling the reflection of an incident particle on collision with a surface. The surface roughness affects the direction of the particle velocity and energy exchange with the surface affects the magnitude of the particle velocity. The modelling can be done using molecular dynamics (that operates in the atomic scale and cannot efficiently incorporate surface roughness) or by stochastic methods like the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00411457108231440" target="_blank">CL model</a> or the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2017.08.061" target="_blank">LLY model</a>. These models were described in the report delivered to SPARC Industries. The LLY model mimics trends resulting from molecular dynamics simulation and also takes surface roughness into account. The LLY model was implemented in Python and tested by comparing the results with those in the paper as well by running plausibility tests. A unit testing script was also written. The code and explanation of techniques used to speed up simulation were delivered to the company.</li><br>
					
	<li> Surface erosion: This involves modeling the surface erosion due to bombardment by incident particles. This is done by first determining the 'sputtering yield' for a gas-surface combination. 'Sputtering yield' is the measure of surface atoms lost due to the impact of a single incident atom. Once the 'sputtering yield' has been determined for different incident polar angles and energies for a particular gas-surface combination, one can predict the erosion rate of the surface, provided the plasma flow simulation is accurate. There are 4 methods to do so: Molecular dynamics, Stochastic, Semi-empirical, and transport. Within these 4 methods, there are different models that were described in the report delivered to SPARC industries.</li></ol>

	<h3>Literature study and preliminary design of a solar thermal propulsion system for a Lunar CubeSat mission</h3>
	<p>The project consisted of coming up with a concept design of a solar propulsion thermal system satisfying the requirements of the LUMIO (LUnar Meteoroid Impacts Observer) mission which is an ESA selected proposal for a CubeSat mission to a halo orbit at Earth–Moon second Lagrange point to observe, quantify, and characterize meteoroid impacts on the lunar far side. The project report was a deliverable for the <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=54413" target="_blank">Micropropulsion [AE4S07] course</a> at TU Delft. <br><br>
	Trade-offs were performed on several sub-system concepts to select a set best satisfying the requirements. Operation of the propulsion system was described and whenever possible, a trace to a requirement was included. Iterations were performed over a parametric range to come up with parameters that yielded optimum mass and volume. Corresponding to these parameters results such as total mass, total volume, and nozzle shape were determined. Sizing for an equivalent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> monopropellant system was also performed over the same parametric range for comparison.</p>

	<h3>Assessing flight path vulnerabilities over the himalayan terrain</h3>
	<p> A computational system was developed linking the weather simulation model, WRF, and the CFD software, Star-CCM+, to assess the affect of a weather system on an aircraft. A system demonstration was carried out using a case study of a scenic mountain flight on a Beechcraft 1900D aircraft from Kathmandu to Mt. Everest and back on the 9th of July 2018 2115 hr UTC. The project demonstrates the importance of such a system and how it can be used by the aviation industry to optimize flight planning and ultimately save cost and lives. </p>

	<h3>Bending and elastic stability study of Functionally graded graphene reinforced porous nanocomposite curved beams</h3>
	<p>Static bending and elastic stability analyses were carried out on functionally graded graphene platelets reinforced porous nanocomposite curved beams using higher order shear deformation theory that accounts for through-thickness stretching effects. The structural characteristics of curved beam, constituting of porous metal foam and graphene platelets as nanofillers for reinforcement, are evaluated considering different dispersion patterns for the graphene and porosity, shallowness of the curved beam, thickness ratio, and platelet geometry.</p>

	<h3>AIAA Design Competition: Undergraduate Team Space Transportation – Pluto Orbiter</h3>
	<p>An orbital exploration mission of the Pluto-Charon system was proposed. For the competition, teams had to design a spacecraft and mission that can achieve orbital insertion into the Pluto-Charon system with a primary mission length of no more than 25 years with a minimum of a one year Pluto orbital duration.<br>
	My work primarily involved selecting the propulsion and power systems for the spacecraft which involved the development of a <a href="https://github.com/anant347/Ion-Propulsion-system-comparison-tool.git" target="_blank">script</a> to perform trade-offs between several commercial ion-propulsion engines constrained to the mission's requirement.</p>
